# tic-tac-toe-by-anant
Tic-tac-toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game for two players, traditionally known as "X" and "O", who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid [1]. The objective for both players is to be the first to get three of their marks in a row—vertically, horizontally, or diagonally [1].
